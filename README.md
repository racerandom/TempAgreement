# TempAgreement
* Please install the python library (implemented by Thomas Grill) for calculating Krippendorffâ€™s alpha before executing our code.
  pip install krippendorff

* Edit "TempAgreement.py" to overwrite "annotator1_dir" and "annotator2_dir" in the main function. "annotator1_dir" and "annotator2_dir" are the absolute paths of two folds including annotation.

* run "python TempAgreement.py"


It will show the agreement ratio for each timeml file. Overall krippendorff_alpha and agreement numbers will be listed in final.
