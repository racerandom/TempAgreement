# TempAgreement
* Please install the python library (implemented by Thomas Grill) for calculating Krippendorffâ€™s alpha before executing our code.  
  clone https://github.com/grrrr/krippendorff-alpha into a folder
  run "python setup.py install" in the folder

* Edit "TempAgreement.py" to assign "annotator1_dir" and "annotator2_dir" with the absolute paths of two folds including annotation in the main function.

* run "python TempAgreement.py"


The results will show the agreement ratio for each timeml file. Overall krippendorff_alpha and agreement numbers will be listed in the final.
